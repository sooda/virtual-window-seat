given:
	- all camera positions (world origin is fixed at one of them)
	- all camera image planes too, i.e., have their corner 3D positions
	- known cube coordinates around the whole thing

need:
	image coordinates of all camera plane corners

plan:
	- for each camera:
		- obtain camera origin and image plane corners in world reference
		- for each plane (can predetermine):
			- for each corner:
				- obtain unit vector v from camera to corner c
				- intersect camera + d*v = plane
				- obtain projected point p on plane, in global 3d coords
				- need this coord in image pixel 2D
				- xform this point p to plane reference coords
				- z is always zero, just map x and y to pixel units and there it is
